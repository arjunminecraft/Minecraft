Read the Instructions properly...

You can go to GitHub repo and directly open using GitHub Desktop then you can host 

After playing game, changes will be made which should be recognised and shown in GitHub Desktop, then you can push to origin.

Next time when we play, I can open GitHub repo and open with GitHub Desktop and start hosting as it already has updated world 

And so on...
